# Chapter 1

Madoc Hawthorne leaned against the rough-hewn wooden frame of the kitchen doorway. He felt the coarse texture of the wood under his fingers. At twenty-two, he was already marked by the weight of responsibility that came with being the man of the house. His introverted nature often led him to find solace in these quiet moments. He watched his mother, Cassandra, and his younger sister, Aria, bustling around the kitchen.

Madoc’s frame filled the doorway, his presence both reassuring and formidable. He wasn't a large man but he was tall and strong. His dark hair, tousled from a day’s work in the mines, fell into eyes the color of storm clouds—deep gray with flecks of blue. His face, though young, bore the hardened lines of someone who had faced more than his share of hardship. His strong jaw and high cheekbones gave him a rugged, determined look. Calloused hands and muscular arms spoke of years of physical labor. Yet his movements were surprisingly gentle, a testament to the care he took with those he loved. Despite the dirt and grime that often coated his skin, his bearing had a certain grace. A quiet strength that emanated from within.

The rich, yeasty scent of fresh-baked bread mingled with the earthy aroma of simmering frostgourd stew, filled the air. The fire crackled merrily in the hearth. Its golden light cast dancing shadows across the worn wooden beams of their home, Giving the room a cozy, inviting glow.

Cassandra’s gentle smile widened as she expertly kneaded the dough. Her warm brown eyes twinkled with amusement as she teased Aria about her haphazard chopping. Despite the hardships they had faced, Cassandra remained a pillar of strength. She instilled in Madoc the values of perseverance and resilience. Her hands, worn yet graceful, moved with practiced ease, shaping the dough into perfect loaves. She possessed a deep inner peace and wisdom. Her sparkling eyes and constant smile reflected her nurturing and compassionate nature. Cassandra was incredibly resourceful and hardworking. She managed their modest household and farm with grace and efficiency. Her playful side often emerged in affectionate teasing, bringing light and laughter into their home.

Aria’s bright blue eyes sparked with mischief. She flitted around the kitchen like a hummingbird. At twelve-years-old, she possessed a youthful exuberance that often led her into many adventures and mischief. She bore a striking resemblance to her older brother, inheriting his piercing eyes and tousled chestnut hair. Yet, while Madoc exuded a rugged charm, Aria's beauty was more innocent and angelic, with rosy cheeks and a contagious smile that lit up her face. Her insatiable curiosity drove her to constantly seek out new experiences and knowledge. Whether she was exploring the woods near their home or delving into the pages of her favorite books. Despite her mischievous antics, Aria’s heart was always in the right place. She possessed a kind and compassionate nature, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need and fiercely protective of her loved ones.

As he watched his family work, a warm sense of belonging washed over him. They were his anchors in a world full of uncertainties. His Mother's laughter echoed through the kitchen, a sound that never failed to lift his spirits. She teased Aria about her vegetable-chopping skills, and Aria responded with a pout, her cheeks flushed with exertion.

Madoc stepped into the kitchen, the worn wooden floorboards creaking under his weight. With a glint in his eyes, he reached for a handful of raw vegetables from the bowl beside his sister.

Aria shot him a mock scowl as she swatted at his hand. "Hey, hands off!" she protested, her voice filled with feigned indignation. "Those are for the stew!"
Madoc chuckled, dodging Aria’s swipes with practiced ease. "Ah, but where’s the harm in a little taste test?" he countered, popping a carrot into his mouth.
Aria rolled her eyes, "You're impossible!" she chided, though her tone held no real reprimand. "One of these days, you’re going to regret stealing from my stew."

Madoc grinned and swallowed the last of the stolen vegetables. Flashing Aria a roguish wink. "Not a chance," he replied, his voice light. His confidence shone through in these playful exchanges, a stark contrast to his normally reserved demeanor.

Madoc turned to find his mother, Cassandra, watching him as he bantered with Aria. He sauntered over to her side. "Looks like Aria’s making quite the feast tonight," Madoc remarked. His voice filled with affection as he glanced at the array of ingredients spread out before them.

Cassandra chuckled, her warm brown eyes crinkling at the corners with amusement. "Indeed she is," she replied, her tone gentle and indulgent. "I forgot a few things at the mine after work," he said. "I’ll need to go back and grab them before it gets too late."

Cassandra nodded. "Of course," she said. "Be sure to hurry back before dinner. Your sister won’t be happy if you make her stew go cold."

With a quick nod, Madoc kissed his mother’s cheek and made his way out of the house. The familiar path led him past their neighbor. Eldric had become a close family friend. His support had been invaluable since his father’s passing,
"Hey, Eldric!" Madoc called out, a warm smile spreading across his face as he approached his friend. "Heading home from the smithy?"

Eldric turned towards Madoc, returning his smile with one of his own. "That’s right," he replied, his voice gruff but filled with warmth. "Just finished up for the day. What about you? What brings you out here?"

"I forgot some things at the mine earlier," Madoc explained, gesturing toward the mountains. "I’m heading back to grab them before dinner."
Eldric waved goodbye. "Good luck."

"Thanks, Eldric. See you later!"

As Madoc continued on his way toward the mine, his thoughts turned to his father, Harlan Hawthorne. It had been eight long years since Harlan’s passing, yet not a day went by that Madoc didn’t think of him. His father had been a strong, kind-hearted man, with a passion for his work in the mines and a love for his family that knew no bounds. Madoc’s determination to honor his father’s memory was a driving force in his life, pushing him to work hard and protect his family.

Madoc’s mind drifted back to that fateful day when his father’s death had turned their family’s world upside down. It had started like any other day. Harlan headed off to work in the mines, leaving behind his wife and two children. With unspoken promises of returning home in time for dinner. But fate had other plans.

One of the tunnels had collapsed, trapping Harlan and several other miners deep underground. The news had spread like wildfire through the town, sending shock waves of fear and despair rippling through the community. Hours had stretched into agonizing days as rescue teams worked tirelessly to reach the trapped miners. Their hope dwindled with each passing moment.

During those dark hours of uncertainty, Eldric had stepped forward. He was a pillar of strength for their family. Together, they had waited anxiously for news of Harlan’s fate. They Clung to the hope that he would emerge from the darkness. But when the rescue teams finally reached the trapped miners, they found what everyone already knew in their hearts.

They had found Harlan’s lifeless body amidst the rubble of the collapsed tunnel. The loss was a devastating blow to the Hawthorne family, leaving them reeling with grief.

As Madoc walked, his heart was heavy with the weight of memories. He couldn’t help but feel gratitude towards Eldric for his kindness and support. Despite the passing years, the pain of his father’s loss still lingered. It was a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the importance of cherishing those we hold dear.

When Madoc reached the entrance to the mine, he realized he had arrived at his destination. Blinking in the dim light, he went to the small building nestled into the side of the mountain. Its weathered wooden frame blended seamlessly with the rocky terrain.

Madoc approached the building and fumbled for the keyring hanging from his belt. The metal jangled as he sorted through the keys, his fingers searching until he found the one he was looking for. With a click, he unlocked the door and stepped inside. The cool darkness of the storage room enveloped him like a shroud.

As his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he went to the back of the room where a sturdy vault stood sentinel against the rough-hewn walls. He pulled out a second key and unlocked the heavy steel door. Prying it open, he went inside.
Nestled in the vault were several small stones, each casting a warm glow over the small room. The light they emitted was gentle yet illuminating. These stones were no ordinary rocks; they were bonded with light. The magic of light binding was rare and valuable, a skill that Madoc had yet to discover within himself.

Madoc reached out to retrieve one of the stones, marveling at the brilliance of their glow even after using them hundreds of times. Twice as bright as a standard lantern, their luminous aura cast a warmth that chased away the chill of the underground. Madoc grabbed a stone. There was a sense of anticipation stirring within him. The mine held many dangers.

He made his way into the mine nestled next to the storage room. The cool, damp air enveloped him, carrying the earthy scent of stone and metal. The soft glow of the light stones guided his steps.

Finally, he reached the large cavern that served as the hub of the mine. Its vast expanse stretched out before him. At the center of the cavern loomed the main shaft, a massive hole in the ground with an intricate pulley system attached to the ceiling. The miners would lower themselves down into the depths of the earth. The giant wheels and creaking chains of the elevator dropped them into the caverns below.

That night, Madoc was not there to descend into the depths. Instead, he turned his attention to the wall where the miners had carved several large holes into the rock. These makeshift alcoves served as storage spaces for the miners. They provided a place to stow their equipment and belongings while they worked.
Madoc gathered his belongings, a set of sturdy mining attire, and a pair of worn boots. The main reason he came back was for a finely crafted sword forged by the skilled hands of his friend Eldric. The blade gleamed dully in the dim light, its edge keen and sharp. It was a reassuring presence at his side in the darkness of the mine.

Madoc couldn’t help but feel a sense of anticipation stirring within him. The mine held its dangers, from treacherous tunnels to lurking creatures that prowled the shadows. Frostbanes were common in the mines. Small animals with thick fur that provided insulation against the cold mountain winds. They had powerful jaws and sharp claws, which they used for digging. The shelter the mine provided from the relentless cold drew them in.

With his equipment secured, Madoc turned on his heel and made his way back towards the entrance of the mine.

As Madoc approached the mouth of the canyon, his eyes widened in alarm at the sight of thick smoke billowing over the village. A stark contrast against the orange second sunset of the twin suns. His heart raced as he quickened his pace, the urgency of the situation propelled him forward. With each hurried step, the distant sounds grew louder. The clamor of panicked voices mingled with the crackling of flames and the sound of distant screams.

As he drew nearer to the village, realization dawned like a thunderbolt. This wasn’t a mere accident—it was a raid, a brutal assault on the very heart of their community. People darted to and fro, their faces contorted with fear as they scrambled for safety. The air was thick with the acrid scent of smoke, choking Madoc’s lungs. His mind raced with questions as he searched for any sign of his family amidst the chaos.

Anguish gripped his heart as he watched in horror, helpless to stop the devastation that unfolded before his eyes. But even as fear and uncertainty threatened to overwhelm him, a steely resolve took root within him.
Madoc’s senses were on high alert as he made his way through the village streets. He couldn’t shake the feeling of dread that coiled in the pit of his stomach. The flickering flames cast erratic shadows, making it difficult to remain unseen. Every shadow seemed to hold unseen threats; every step felt like a gamble, each corner a potential trap waiting to be sprung.

Halfway to his house, Madoc froze as a pair of raiders emerged from the darkness ahead. Their figures loomed ominously in the flickering firelight. His breath caught in his throat as he pressed himself against the nearest building. His heart pounded as he realized that they saw him.

Madoc watched as the raiders locked eyes on him, their faces twisted into cruel sneers. Without hesitation, they broke into a sprint.

Adrenaline surged through Madoc’s veins as he bolted into action. His mind raced as he calculated his next move. He knew he couldn’t outrun them, but he refused to go down without a fight. As the raiders closed in, their eyes glinting with malice. Madoc’s instincts kicked into overdrive. He broke into a sprint, dodging between burning buildings and leaping over debris.

Pulling his sword from the sheath as he rounded the back of one of the buildings, red flames scorched the side of his face and he ducked down. His only hope now was to take one of them by surprise. As he stepped around the corner, Madoc rammed his sword into the raider, a young man in his twenties, probably the same age as Madoc.

Madoc had never taken a human life before. The occasional frostbane in the mines had terrified him, but he had never felt fear like this before. Seeing the light of life fade from another person killed by his hand made him nauseous. And there was still another raider who would gladly kill him if he didn’t continue to fight.

Madoc’s heart raced as he faced off against the second raider, his grip tight on the hilt of his sword. With a glance around, he took stock of his surroundings, searching for any advantage he could use.

As the raider lunged forward, sword raised high, Madoc leaped to the side, narrowly avoiding the blade as it slashed through the air. He ducked behind a crumbling wall, using the cover to assess his options.

With a surge of desperation, Madoc spotted a loose beam jutting out from one of the burning buildings. He dashed towards it. Reached out and grabbed hold.
With a heave, Madoc wrenched the burning beam free, sending it crashing down towards the raider. The raider stumbled back in surprise. His sword clattered to the ground as he struggled to evade the makeshift weapon hurtling towards him.

With a sickening thud, the beam connected with its target, knocking the raider off his feet and sending him sprawling to the ground. For a moment, everything was still, the chaos of the battle momentarily suspended in time.
Gasping for breath, Madoc stood over the fallen raider, his hands trembling as he tried to steady himself. The weight of what he had done settled on his shoulders, a crushing reminder of the violence of the world.

But as he looked down at the unconscious figure before him, a flicker of resolve ignited. He may not have wanted this fight, but he refused to be a victim. With a deep breath, he gathered his strength and steeled himself for whatever may come next.

As he rushed into his house. The air was thick with the stench of smoke and blood, the flickering flames casting eerie shadows across the walls. His eyes fell upon Eldric, kneeling in the same doorway where Madoc had stood only hours earlier. Watching his mother and sister prepare dinner.

But now, instead of the warmth of home and family, there was only sorrow and loss. Two raiders lay dead at Eldric’s feet. Eldric’s normally stoic demeanor was shattered. Tears streaming down his weathered face as he gazed upon the lifeless bodies of Madoc’s family.

Madoc’s heart wrenched in his chest as he took in the sight before him. The weight of grief pressed down on him like a leaden cloak. His sword slipped from his fingers, clattering to the ground next to where Eldric had dropped his moments before. He sunk to his knees beside his friend.

Madoc reached out, laying a hand on Eldric’s shoulder, offering what little comfort he could. Together, they mourned their loss. Their tears mingled with the ashes of their shattered dreams.

At that moment, as they knelt side by side, Madoc realized that nothing would ever be the same again. The innocence of his childhood had been stripped away. It was replaced by the harsh reality of a world torn apart by violence and cruelty.

The flames continued to rage outside, casting their long shadows across the landscape. Madoc and Eldric clung to each other, drawing strength from their shared bond. In the darkness, they found solace in the light of their friendship.
